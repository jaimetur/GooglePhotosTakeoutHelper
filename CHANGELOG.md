## 4.1.0-Xentraxx - Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements

### ✨ **New Features**

- **Partner Sharing Support** - Added `--divide-partner-shared` flag to separate partner shared media from personal uploads into dedicated `PARTNER_SHARED` folder (Issue #56)
  - Automatically detects partner shared photos from JSON metadata (`googlePhotoOrigin.fromPartnerSharing`)
  - Creates separate folder structure while maintaining date division and album organization
  - Works with all album handling modes (shortcut, duplicate-copy, reverse-shortcut, json, nothing)
  - Preserves album relationships for partner shared media
- **Added folder year date extraction strategy** - New fallback date extractor that extracts year from parent folder names like "Photos from 2005" when other extraction methods fail (Issue #28)
- **Centralized concurrency management** - Introduced `ConcurrencyManager` for consistent concurrency calculations across all services, eliminating hardcoded multipliers scattered throughout the codebase
- **Displaying version of Exiftool when found** - Instead of just displaying that Exif tool was found, we display the version now as well.

### 🚀 **Performance Improvements**

- **EXIF processing optimization** - Native `exif_reader` library integration for 15-40% performance improvement in EXIF data extraction
  - Uses fast native library for supported formats (JPEG, TIFF, HEIC, PNG, WebP, AVIF, JXL, CR3, RAF, ARW, DNG, CRW, NEF, NRW)
  - Automatic fallback to ExifTool for unsupported formats or when native extraction fails
  - Centralized MIME type constants verified against actual library source code
  - Improved error logging with GitHub issue reporting guidance when native extraction fails
- **GPS coordinate extraction optimization** - Dedicated coordinate extraction service with native library support
  - 15-40% performance improvement for GPS-heavy photo collections
  - Clean architectural separation between date and coordinate extraction
  - Centralized MIME type support across all EXIF processing operations
- **Significantly increased parallelization** - Changed CPU concurrency multiplier from ×2 to ×8 for most operations, dramatically improving performance on multi-core systems
- **Removed concurrency caps** - Eliminated `.clamp()` limits that were artificially restricting parallelization on high-core systems
- **Platform-optimized concurrency**:
  - **Linux**: Improved from `CPU cores + 1` to `CPU cores × 8` (massive improvement for Linux users)
  - **macOS**: Improved from `CPU cores + 1` to `CPU cores × 6` 
  - **Windows**: Maintained at `CPU cores × 8` (already optimized)
- **Operation-specific concurrency tuning**:
  - **Hash operations**: `CPU cores × 4` (balanced for CPU + I/O workload)
  - **EXIF/Metadata**: `CPU cores × 6` (I/O optimized for modern SSDs)
  - **Duplicate detection**: `CPU cores × 6` (memory intensive, conservative)
  - **Network operations**: `CPU cores × 16` (high for I/O waiting)
- **Adaptive concurrency scaling** - Dynamic performance-based concurrency adjustment that scales up to ×24 for high-performance scenarios

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes**

- **Fixed memory exhaustion during ZIP extraction** - Implemented streaming extraction to handle large ZIP files without running out of memory
- **Fixed atomic file operations** - Changed to atomic file rename operations to resolve situations where only the json was renamed in file extension correction (Issue #60)
- **Fixed album relationship processing** - Improved album relationship service to handle edge cases properly (Issue #61)
- **Fixed interactive presenter display** - Corrected display issue in interactive mode (Issue #62)
- **Fixed date division behavior for albums** - The `--divide-to-dates` flag now only applies to ALL_PHOTOS folder, leaving album folders flattened without date subfolders (Issue #55)
- **Reaorganised ReadMe for a more intuitive structure** - First Installation, then prerequisites and then the quickstart.
- **Step 8 now also uses a progress bar instead of simple print statements**
- **Supressed some unnecessary ouput**

## 4.0.9-Xentraxx - Major Architecture Refactor

### 🛡️ **BREAKING CHANGE: Copy Mode Completely Removed**

This release removes the `--copy` flag and all copy mode functionality to ensure **complete input directory safety** and eliminate data integrity issues.

#### **Why This Change Was Made**
- **Input Directory Protection**: Copy mode was modifying files in the input directory during extension fixing and filename sanitization, violating the principle of data safety
- **Simplified Architecture**: Removes complex conditional logic that led to inconsistent behavior
- **Clearer User Intent**: All operations now clearly move files from input to output, with no ambiguity
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Eliminates edge cases where input files could be modified unexpectedly

#### **Breaking Changes**
- **❌ Removed**: `--copy` command line flag
- **❌ Removed**: `copyMode` from all configuration APIs
- **❌ Removed**: Copy-related conditional logic throughout codebase
- **✅ New Behavior**: All files are **always moved** from input to output directory

#### **Migration Guide**
- **Before**: `gpth --input source --output dest --copy`
- **After**: `gpth --input source --output dest` (copy flag no longer needed or supported)
- **Result**: Files will be moved (not copied) from source to destination
- **Behavior**: Files are relocated from input to output directory with metadata processing applied

#### **Technical Implementation**
- **FileOperationService**: Simplified to move-only operations with cross-device copy+delete fallback
- **Moving Strategies**: All strategies now use consistent move semantics
- **Album Strategies**: Duplicate copy strategy still creates copies in album folders when needed
- **Configuration System**: Streamlined without copy mode complexity

#### **Benefits**
- **⚡ Better Performance**: Simplified logic reduces overhead
- **🧹 Cleaner Codebase**: Removed 400+ lines of conditional copy logic
- **🎯 Clearer Semantics**: Move operations are explicit and predictable

### 🛡️ **BREAKING CHANGE: fix extension flag renamed**

- **Consolidated extension fixing flags** into unified `--fix-extensions=<mode>` option
  - **Before**: `--fix-extensions`, `--fix-extensions-non-jpeg`, `--fix-extensions-solo-mode`
  - **After**: `--fix-extensions=<mode>` with `none`, `standard`, `conservative`, `solo` modes

### 🏗️ **Complete Architecture Overhaul**

This release represents a fundamental restructuring of the codebase following **Clean Architecture** principles, providing better maintainability, testability, and performance.

## 4.0.8-Xentraxx

### Interactive ZIP File Extraction Restored

#### Major Feature Restoration
- **Restored interactive ZIP file extraction functionality** that was previously deprecated due to photo loss issues
- Added comprehensive security measures to prevent data loss and security vulnerabilities
- Implemented user-friendly choice between automatic ZIP extraction or using pre-extracted directories

#### New Interactive ZIP Features
- **`askIfUnzip()` function**: Provides users with clear options for handling Google Takeout data:
  - Option 1: Select ZIP files for automatic extraction (Recommended)
  - Option 2: Use already extracted directory
- **Enhanced `getZips()` function**: Improved file picker with better validation and user feedback
- **Secure `unzip()` function**: Comprehensive ZIP extraction with multiple safety layers

#### Security and Safety Improvements
- **ZIP Slip Protection**: Prevents malicious ZIP files from extracting outside the target directory
- **Cross-platform filename sanitization**: Handles encoding issues and invalid characters safely
- **Comprehensive error handling**: User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
- **File integrity validation**: Verifies ZIP files before extraction
- **Progress reporting**: Real-time feedback during extraction process

#### Technical Enhancements
- **`_extractZipSafely()` helper**: Internal function with security checks and encoding handling
- **`_sanitizeFileName()` helper**: Cross-platform filename normalization and safety checks
- **`_handleExtractionError()` helper**: Context-specific error handling with detailed guidance
- **`SecurityException` class**: Custom exception for handling security-related extraction issues

#### Workflow Integration
- Seamlessly integrated into interactive mode with clear user prompts

### Extension Fixing Feature

- Added comprehensive file extension correction functionality to handle mismatched MIME types and extensions
- Added three CLI flags for different extension fixing behaviors:
  - `--fix-extensions`: Fixes incorrect extensions except for TIFF-based files (e.g., RAW formats)
  - `--fix-extensions-non-jpeg`: More conservative mode that also skips actual JPEG files  
  - `--fix-extensions-solo-mode`: Standalone mode that fixes extensions and exits without further processing
- Added interactive prompts for extension fixing configuration with three options for user convenience
- Enhanced EXIF writing error messages to suggest using `--fix-extensions` when extension/MIME type mismatches are detected
- Added comprehensive test coverage for extension fixing functionality including edge cases

### JSON File Matching Improvements

- Added support for removing partial extra format suffixes from truncated filenames (issue #29)
- Enhanced JSON file matching for media files with filename truncation due to filesystem limits
- Added `removePartialExtraFormats` function to handle cases where suffixes like "-ed" need to be removed to match corresponding JSON files
- Improved date extraction reliability for files with truncated names ending in partial extra format patterns

#### Technical Details

When filenames are truncated due to filesystem character limits, partial suffixes (e.g., "-ed" from "-edited") can prevent proper JSON file matching for date extraction. The new functionality identifies and removes these partial patterns, allowing the JSON extractor to find corresponding metadata files and extract accurate photo dates.

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

- Fixed EXIF writing to properly handle files with incorrect extensions by detecting MIME type mismatches
- Improved error logging with more informative messages about extension/MIME type conflicts
- Updated statistics reporting to include count of fixed file extensions
- Enhanced interactive mode with better user guidance for extension fixing options

### Technical Details

The extension fixing feature addresses a common issue where Google Photos' "data saving" option compresses images to JPEG format but retains original file extensions, or where web-downloaded images have incorrect extensions. The tool now:

1. Reads file headers to detect actual MIME type
2. Compares with extension-based MIME type detection
3. Skips TIFF-based files (like RAW formats) as they're often misidentified
4. Renames files with correct extensions and updates associated JSON metadata files
5. Provides detailed logging of the fixing process

The feature integrates seamlessly with the existing EXIF writing workflow, ensuring metadata can be properly written to files after extension correction.

## 4.0.1-wacheee-xentraxx-beta

### Fork/Alternate version 
### This change is a big overhaul of the project, so only the major improvements or potential breaking changes are mentioned
### This version was developed mainly by @Xentraxx (https://github.com/Xentraxx/)

#### Tl;dr

- Added support for reading EXIF data from JXL (JPEG XL), ARW, RAW, DNG, CRW, CR3, NRW, NEF and RAF files internally.
- Adeded support for reading and writing coordinates and DateTime from and to exif for almost all file formats.
- Added a "--write-exif" flag which will write missing EXIF information (coordinates and DateTime) from json to EXIF for jpg and jpeg files
- Added support to get DateTime from .MOV, .MP4 and probably many other video formats through exiftool. You need to download it yourself (e.g. from here: https://exiftool.org/), rename it to exiftool.exe and make sure the folder you keep it in is in your $PATH variable or in the same folder as gpth.
- Added verbose mode (--verbose or -v)
- File size is not limited anymore by default but can be limited using the --limit-filesize flag for systems with low RAM (like a NAS).
- Fixed [PhotoMigrator](https://github.com/jaimetur/PhotoMigrator) integration by finding exiftool in more locations.
- Fixed some typos
- Fixed emoji to hex encoding and decoding and added support for BMP emojis in addition to surrowgate.
- Fixed some tests 


#### General improvements

- upgraded dependencies and fixed breaking changes
- updated dart to a minimum version of 3.8.0 of the dart SDK
- included image, intl and coordinate_converter packages
- applied a list of coding best practices through lint rules to code
- added/edited a bunch of comments and changed unnecessary print() to log() for debugging and a better user experience
- Divided code in steps through comments and included steps in output for readability, debuggability and to make it easier to follow the code
- checked TODOs in README.md
- Added TODOs to look into in code through //TODO comments
- moved json_extractor file into date_extractor folder
- added unit tests for new write-exif functionality
- made CLI --help output more readable through line breaks
- renamed some variables/functions to better reflect their purpose
- moved step 8 (update creation time) before final output
- added output how often DateTime and Coordinates have been written in EXIF at the final output
- changed that test data will be created in test subfolder instead of project root directory
- Added consistent log levels to log output to quickly differenciate between informational and error logs
- Added logging of elapsed time for each step.
- Exposed the maxFileSize flag as an argument (--limit-filesize) to set if necessary, It's now deactivated by default to support larger files like videos.
- Added DateTime extraction method statistics to the final output - shows how many files had their dates extracted through which method
- Added elapsed time logging for each processing step
- Improved Github actions

#### Bug fixes

- fixed existing unit tests which would fail on windows
- Fixed Github Actions

#### Added functionality

- Support for writing coordinates and DateTime to EXIF
  - Added new CLI option "--write-exif".
  - When enabled, the script will check if the associated json of any given file contains coordinates and if the file does not yet have them in its EXIF data, the script will add them.
  - When enabled, the script will check if a DateTime has been extracted from any of the given extraction methods and if the file has no EXIF DateTime set, it will add the DateTime to the EXIF data 'DateTime', 'DateTimeOriginal'and 'DateTimeDigitized'.
  - Added verbose mode (--verbose or -v) with log levels info, warning and error.

- Moved from the stale "exif" package to "exif_reader" for dart local exif reading, the image library for local jpeg exif writing and the external exiftool for all other EXIF reading and writing (images and videos)
  - The move to exif_reader adds support for extracting DateTime from JXL (JPEG XL), ARW, RAW, DNG, CRW, CR3, NRW, NEF and RAF files, and video formats like MOV, MP4, etc.
  - Exiftool needs to be in $PATH variable or in the same folder as the running binary. If not, that's okay. Then we fall back to exif_reader. But if you have ExifTool locally, Google Photos Takeout Helper now supports reading CreatedDateTime EXIF data for almost all media formats.

- Added new interactive prompts:
  - Option to write EXIF data to files (--write-exif)
  - Option to limit file size for systems with low RAM (--limit-filesize)

#### Limitations
- As mentioned on the PR https://github.com/Wacheee/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper/pull/13#issuecomment-2910289503 this version can be slower than 3.6.x-wacheee in Windows because is using PowerShell to create shortcuts (FFI is causing heap exception)

- *added more options for date-based folders [year, month, day] #238 (based in this commit [`More granular date folders #299`](https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper/pull/299/commits/d06fe73101845acd650bc025d2977b96bbd1bf1d))*
- *added reverse-shortcut option, now you can mantain original photo in album folders and create a shortcut in year albums*
  
##### *Limitations (previous fixes):*
- *if album mode is set to duplicate-copy, it will move the album photos to the album folder (as usual), but ALL_PHOTOS will not contain them if the media is not in a year album.*
- *it does not fix issues related to reading JSON files (if necessary) for Motion Photo files; however, if the dates are included in the file name (as with Pixel Motion Photos), the correct dates will be established.*

## 3.5.2-wacheee

### Fork/Alternate version 
#### New option to update creation time at the end of program - Windows only

- added an interactive option to update the creation times of files in the output folder to match their last modified times at the end of the program #371

Limitations:

##### *Previous fixes and improvement (from 3.4.3-wacheee to 3.5.1-wacheee)*
- *if a media is not in a year folder it establishes one from an album to move it to ALL_PHOTOS correctly. This will move the original media file directly from the album (or one of those albums) to ALL_PHOTOS and create a shortcut in the output album folder (if shortcut option is selected) #261*
- *added support for moving or copying files with the following extensions to the output folder: .MP, .MV, .DNG, and .CR2 #381 #324 #180 #271*

## 3.5.1-wacheee

### Fork/Alternate version 
#### Always move to ALL_PHOTOS even if it is not present in year album

- if a media is not in a year folder it establishes one from an album to move it to ALL_PHOTOS correctly. This will move the original media file directly from the album (or one of those albums) to ALL_PHOTOS and create a shortcut in the output album folder (if shortcut option is selected) #261

Limitations:
- if album mode is set to duplicate-copy, it will move the album photos to the album folder (as usual), but ALL_PHOTOS will not contain them if the media is not in a year album.

## 3.4.3

### Just a few patches ❤️‍🩹

- put stuff in `date-unknown` also when not div-to-dates - #245
- fix extras detection on mac - #243
- add note to not worry about album finding ;)
- nice message when trying to run interactive on headless

## 3.4.2

### Bug fixes again 🐛

- (maybe?) fix weird windoza trailing spaces in folder names (literally wtf??) - #212
  
  Not sure about this one so hope there will be no day-1 patch 😇🙏

- update to Dart 3 🔥
- recognize `.mts` files as videos, unlike Apache 😒 - #223
- change shortcuts/symlinks to relative so it doesn't break on folder move 🤦 - #232
- don't fail on set-file-modification errors - turns out there are lot of these - #229

### Happy takeouts 👽

## 3.4.1

- Lot of serious bug fixes
  - Interactive unzipping was disabled because it sometimes lost *a lot of* photos ;_;
    
    Sorry if anyone lost anything - now I made some visual instruction on how to unzip
  - Gracefully handle powershell fail - it fails with non-ascii names :(
- Great improvement on json matching - now, my 5k Takeout has 100% matches!

## 3.4.0

### Albums 🎉

It finally happened everyone! It wasn't easy, but I think I nailed it and everything should perfectly 👌

You get **_🔥FOUR🔥_** different options on how you want your albums 😱 - detailed descriptions about them is at: https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper/discussions/187#discussion-4980576

(This also automatically nicely covers Trash/Archive, so previous solution that originally closed the https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper/issues/138 was replaced)

### Happy Take-outing 🥳 

## 3.3.5

- Address #178 issues in logs - instructions on what to do

  Sorry but this is all i can do for now :( we may get actual fix if https://github.com/brendan-duncan/archive/pull/244 ever moves further

## 3.3.4

- New name-guess patterns from @matt-boris <3
- Support 19**-s and 18**-s while name guessing
  > First camera was invented in 1839. I don't underestimate you guys anymore :eyes:
- Fix path errors on windoza while unzipping #172
- Fix #175 bad guessing json files with `...(1)` stuff

## 3.3.3

- Fix memory crashes :D
- nicer names for split-to-dates thanks to @denouche #168 <3

## 3.3.2

- Bump SDK and dependencies

## 3.3.1

### Fix bugs introduced in `v3.3.0` 🤓

- #147 Support `.tgz` files too
- #145 **DON'T** use ram memory equal to zip file thanks to `asyncWrite: true` flag 🙃
- #143 don't crash when encoding is other than `utf8` 🍰
- #136 #144 - On windzoa, set time to 1970 if it's before that - would love to *actually* fix this, but Dart doesn't let me :/

## 3.3.0

- Fix #143 - issues when encoding is not utf8 - sadly, others are still not supported, just skipped
- Ask for divide-to-folders in interactive
- Close #138 - support Archive/Trash folders!

  Implementation of this is a bit complicated, so may break, but should work 99% times
- Fix #134 - nicely tell user what to do when no "year folders" instead of exceptions
- Fix #92 - Much better json finding!
  
  It now should find all of those `...-edited(1).jpg.json` - this also makes it faster because it rarely falls back to reading exif, which is slower
- More small fixes and refactors

### Enjoy even faster and more stable `gpth` everyone 🥳🥳🥳

## 3.2.0

- Brand new ✨interactive mode✨ - just double click 🤘
  - `gpth` now uses 💅discontinued💅 [`file_picker_desktop`](https://pub.dev/packages/file_picker_desktop) to launch pickers for user to select output folder and input...
  - ...zips 🤐! because it also decompresses the takeouts for you! (People had ton of trouble of how to join them etc - no worries anymore!)
- Donation link

## 3.1.1

- Code sign windoza exe with self-made cert

## 3.1.0

## 3.0.0

- Dart!

- Consistency - it is well known what script does, what does it copy and what not
- Stable album detection (tho still don't know what to do with it)
- [Testing!](https://youtu.be/UGSgpvjHp9o?t=292)
- Better json matching
- `--guess-from-name` is now a default
- `--skip-extras-harder` is missing for now
- `--divide-to-dates` is missing for now
- End-to-end tests are gone, but they're not as required since we have a lod of Units instead 👍
