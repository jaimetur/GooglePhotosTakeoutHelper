## 5.0.0-Xentraxx

### ‚ú® **New Features**
  - Support for 7zip and unzip extractors (if found in your system). This is shy the native extractor does not extract properly filenames or dirnames with latin chars.
  - Support new `Extra` files from Google Takeout with following suffixes: `-motion`, `-animation`, `-collage`.
  - New flag `--keep-input` to Work on a temporary sibling copy of --input (suffix _tmp), keeping the original untouched.
  - New flag `--keep-duplicates` to keep duplicates files in `_Duplicates` subfolder within output folder.
  - Created GitHub Action `build-and-create-release.yml` to Automatically build all binaries, create new release (stable or pre-release), update it wiht the release-notes and upload the binaries to the new release.

### üöÄ **Improvements**
  - `MediaEntity` Class changed
    - Removed `files` attribute
    - Added `primaryFile` and `secondaryFiles` attributes for a better logic.
    - Added `belongToAlbums` attribute to store All Albums where the media entity was found as a `AlbumInfo` List which can contain many usefull info related to the Album.
    - Adapted all methods to work with this new structure
  - All modules have been adapted to the new `MediaEntity` structure.
  - All Tests have been adapted to the new `MediaEntity` structure.
  - Homogenized logs for all steps.
  - Code Structure refactored for a better understanding and easier way to find each module.
  - Code Refactored to isolate the execution logic of each step into the .execute() function of the step's class. In this way the media_entity_collection module is much clearer and easy to understand and maintain.
  - Created a single package gpth-lib with all the exported modules for an easier way to manage imports and refactoring.
  - Added new flag `fallbackToExifToolOnNativeMiss`in `GlobalConfigService` Class to specify if we want to fallback to ExifTool on Native EXIF reader fail. (Normally if Native fails is because EXIF is corrupt, so fallback to ExifTool does not help).
  - Added new flag `enableBatching`in `GlobalConfigService` Class to specify if we want to enable/disable call ExifTool with batches of files instead of one call per file (this speed-up a lot the EXIF writting time with ExifTool).
  - Added new flag `maxExifImageBatchSize`in `GlobalConfigService` Class to specify the maximum number of Images for each batch passed in any call to ExifTool.
  - Added new flag `maxExifVideoBatchSize`in `GlobalConfigService` Class to specify the maximum number of Videos for each batch passed in any call to ExifTool.
  - Added new flag `forceProcessUnsupportedFormats`in `GlobalConfigService` Class to specify if we want to forze process unsupported format such as `.AVI`, `.MPG`or `.BMP` files with ExifTool.
  - Added new flag `silenceUnsupportedWarnings`in `GlobalConfigService` Class to specify if we want to recive or silence warnings due to unsupported format on ExifTool calls.
  - Improvements on Statistics results.

### üêõ **Bug Fixes**
  - Now all supported media files are moved from input folder to output folder. So after running GPTH input folder should only contains .json files and unsupported media types.


## 4.3.1-Xentraxx

### üöÄ **Improvements**
  - Improve Performance in Remove Duplicates Step
  - Change README.md to add Star History & Contributors History

### üêõ **Bug Fixes**
  - Added ask for Albums strategy during interactive mode

## 4.3.0-Xentraxx

### ‚ú® **New Features**
  - New flag `--fileDates` to provide a JSON dictionary with the date per file to void reading it from EXIF when any file does not associated sidecar. (PhotoMigrator creates this file and can now be used by GPTH Tool).
  - Improved log/print messages in all Steps.
  - Added Move Files Summary to the log messages.
  - Now Album's folders are moved into `Albums` folder and No-Album's files are moved into `ALL_PHOTOS` folder using the selected date organization.

### üöÄ **Improvements**

  - #### Step 4 (Extract Dates) & 5 (Write EXIF) Optimization
    - ##### ‚ö° Performance
      - Step 4 (READ-EXIF) now uses batch reads and a fast native mode, with ExifTool only as fallback ‚Üí about 3x faster metadata extraction.  
      - Step 5 (WRITE-EXIF) supports batch writes and argfile mode, plus native JPEG writers ‚Üí up to 5x faster on large collections.
        - The function `writeExifData()` now accepts a parameter called `exifToolBatching` to Enable/Disable Batch processing with Exiftool.
    - ##### üîß API
      - Added batch write methods in `ExifToolService`.  
      - Updated `MediaEntityCollection` to use new helpers for counting written tags.
    - ##### üìä Logging
      - Statistics are clearer: calls, hits, misses, fallback attempts, timings.  
      - Date, GPS, and combined writes are reported separately.  
      - Removed extra blank lines for cleaner output.
    - ##### üß™ Testing
      - Extended mocks with batch support and error simulation.  
      - Added tests for GPS writing, batch operations, and non-image handling.
    - ##### ‚úÖ Benefits
      - Much faster EXIF processing with less ExifTool overhead.  
      - More reliable and structured API.  
      - Logging is easier to read and interpret.  
      - Stronger test coverage across edge cases.  

  - #### Step 6 (Find Albums) Optimization
    - ##### ‚ö° Performance
      - Replaced `_groupIdenticalMedia` with `_groupIdenticalMediaOptimized`.  
        - Two-phase strategy:  
          - First group by file **size** (cheap).  
          - Only hash files that share the same size.  
        - Switched from `readAsBytes()` (full memory load) to **streaming hashing** with `md5.bind(file.openRead())`.  
        - Files are processed in **parallel batches** instead of sequentially.  
        - Concurrency defaults to number of CPU cores, configurable via `maxConcurrent`.
    - ##### üîß Implementation
      - Added an in-memory **hash cache** keyed by `(path|size|mtime)` to avoid recalculating.  
        - Introduced a custom **semaphore** to limit concurrent hashing and prevent I/O overload.  
        - Errors are handled gracefully: unprocessable files go into dedicated groups without breaking the process.
    - ##### ‚úÖ Benefits
      - Processing time reduced from **1m20s ‚Üí 4s** on large collections.  
        - Greatly reduced memory usage.  
        - Scales better on multi-core systems.  
        - More robust and fault-tolerant album detection.  

### üêõ **Bug Fixes**

  - Handle per file exception in WriteExif Step. Now the flow continues if any file fails to write EXIF.
  - Fixed interactive mode when asking to limit the file size.
  - Show dictMiss files in log to see those files that have not been found in dates dictionary when it was passed as argument using --fileDates
  - Fix missing JSON match when the length of the original JSON filename is higher than 51. Now try first with the full filename even if its length is longer than 51 chars, if not match, then try the different truncations variants.
  - Fix Progress bar on Step 7: Move files. Now counts the number of real operations instead of number of move instances.
  - Fixed some other silent exceptions.

## 4.1.1-Xentraxx

### üêõ **Bug Fixes**

  - **changed exif tags to be utilized** - Before we used the following lists of tags in this exact order to find a date to set: 
    - Exiftool reading: 'DateTimeOriginal', 'MediaCreateDate', 'CreationDate', 'TrackCreateDate', 'CreateDate', 'DateTimeDigitized', 'GPSDateStamp' and 'DateTime'.
    - Native dart exif reading: 'Image DateTime', 'EXIF DateTimeOriginal', 'EXIF DateTimeDigitized'.
  Some of those values are prone to deliver wrong dates (e.g. DateTimeDigitized) and the order did not completely make sense.
  We therefore now read those tags and the the oldest DateTime we can find:
    - Exiftool reading: 'DateTimeOriginal','DateTime','CreateDate','DateCreated','CreationDate','MediaCreateDate','TrackCreateDate','EncodedDate','MetadataDate','ModifyDate'.
    - Native dart exif reading: same as above.
  - **Fixed typo in partner sharing** - Functionality was fundamentally broken due to a typo.
  - **Fixed small bug in interactive mode in the options of the limit filezise dialogue**
  - **Fixed unzipping through command line by automatically detecting if input directory contains zip files**

### üöÄ **Improvements**

  - **Improved non-zero exit code quitting behaviour** - Now with nice descriptive error messages because I was tired of looking up what is responsible for a certain exit code.
  - **Standardized concurrency & logging** - All parallel operations now obtain limits exclusively through `ConcurrencyManager` / `GlobalPools` (hashing, EXIF extraction/writing, duplicate detection, grouping, moving, file I/O). Added consistent one-time or operation-start log lines like `Starting N threads (<operation> concurrency)`; removed deprecated `maxConcurrency` parameters and legacy random placeholder logic from `ProcessingLimits`. Lightweight operations (e.g. disk space checks) intentionally left sequential to avoid overhead.

## 4.1.0-Xentraxx - Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements

### ‚ú® **New Features**

- **Partner Sharing Support** - Added `--divide-partner-shared` flag to separate partner shared media from personal uploads into dedicated `PARTNER_SHARED` folder (Issue #56)
  - Automatically detects partner shared photos from JSON metadata (`googlePhotosOrigin.fromPartnerSharing`)
  - Creates separate folder structure while maintaining date division and album organization
  - Works with all album handling modes (shortcut, duplicate-copy, reverse-shortcut, json, nothing)
  - Preserves album relationships for partner shared media

- **Centralized concurrency management** - Introduced `ConcurrencyManager` for consistent concurrency calculations across all services, eliminating hardcoded multipliers scattered throughout the codebase
- **Displaying version of Exiftool when found** - Instead of just displaying that Exif tool was found, we display the version now as well.

### üöÄ **Performance Improvements**

- **EXIF processing optimization** - Native `exif_reader` library integration for 15-40% performance improvement in EXIF data extraction
  - Uses fast native library for supported formats (JPEG, TIFF, HEIC, PNG, WebP, AVIF, JXL, CR3, RAF, ARW, DNG, CRW, NEF, NRW)
  - Automatic fallback to ExifTool for unsupported formats or when native extraction fails
  - Centralized MIME type constants verified against actual library source code

- **Removed concurrency caps** - Eliminated `.clamp()` limits that were artificially restricting parallelization on high-core systems
- **Platform-optimized concurrency**:
  - **Linux**: Improved from `CPU cores + 1` to `CPU cores √ó 8` (massive improvement for Linux users)
  - **macOS**: Improved from `CPU cores + 1` to `CPU cores √ó 6` 
  - **Windows**: Maintained at `CPU cores √ó 8` (already optimized)
- **Operation-specific concurrency tuning**:
  - **Hash operations**: `CPU cores √ó 4` (balanced for CPU + I/O workload)
  - **EXIF/Metadata**: `CPU cores √ó 6` (I/O optimized for modern SSDs)
  - **Duplicate detection**: `CPU cores √ó 6` (memory intensive, conservative)
  - **Network operations**: `CPU cores √ó 16` (high for I/O waiting)
- **Adaptive concurrency scaling** - Dynamic performance-based concurrency adjustment that scales up to √ó24 for high-performance scenarios

### üêõ **Bug Fixes**

- **Fixed memory exhaustion during ZIP extraction** - Implemented streaming extraction to handle large ZIP files without running out of memory
- **Fixed atomic file operations** - Changed to atomic file rename operations to resolve situations where only the json was renamed in file extension correction (Issue #60)
- **Fixed album relationship processing** - Improved album relationship service to handle edge cases properly (Issue #61)
- **Fixed interactive presenter display** - Corrected display issue in interactive mode (Issue #62)
- **Fixed date division behavior for albums** - The `--divide-to-dates` flag now only applies to ALL_PHOTOS folder, leaving album folders flattened without date subfolders (Issue #55)
- **Reaorganised ReadMe for a more intuitive structure** - First Installation, then prerequisites and then the quickstart.
- **Step 8 now also uses a progress bar instead of simple print statements**
- **Supressed some unnecessary ouput**

## 4.0.9-Xentraxx - Major Architecture Refactor

### üõ°Ô∏è **BREAKING CHANGE: Copy Mode Completely Removed**

This release removes the `--copy` flag and all copy mode functionality to ensure **complete input directory safety** and eliminate data integrity issues.

#### **Why This Change Was Made**
- **Input Directory Protection**: Copy mode was modifying files in the input directory during extension fixing and filename sanitization, violating the principle of data safety
- **Simplified Architecture**: Removes complex conditional logic that led to inconsistent behavior
- **Clearer User Intent**: All operations now clearly move files from input to output, with no ambiguity
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Eliminates edge cases where input files could be modified unexpectedly

#### **Breaking Changes**
- **‚ùå Removed**: `--copy` command line flag
- **‚ùå Removed**: `copyMode` from all configuration APIs
- **‚ùå Removed**: Copy-related conditional logic throughout codebase
- **‚úÖ New Behavior**: All files are **always moved** from input to output directory

#### **Migration Guide**
- **Before**: `gpth --input source --output dest --copy`
- **After**: `gpth --input source --output dest` (copy flag no longer needed or supported)
- **Result**: Files will be moved (not copied) from source to destination
- **Behavior**: Files are relocated from input to output directory with metadata processing applied

#### **Technical Implementation**
- **FileOperationService**: Simplified to move-only operations with cross-device copy+delete fallback
- **Moving Strategies**: All strategies now use consistent move semantics
- **Album Strategies**: Duplicate copy strategy still creates copies in album folders when needed
- **Configuration System**: Streamlined without copy mode complexity

#### **Benefits**
- **‚ö° Better Performance**: Simplified logic reduces overhead
- **üßπ Cleaner Codebase**: Removed 400+ lines of conditional copy logic
- **üéØ Clearer Semantics**: Move operations are explicit and predictable

### üõ°Ô∏è **BREAKING CHANGE: fix extension flag renamed**

- **Consolidated extension fixing flags** into unified `--fix-extensions=<mode>` option
  - **Before**: `--fix-extensions`, `--fix-extensions-non-jpeg`, `--fix-extensions-solo-mode`
  - **After**: `--fix-extensions=<mode>` with `none`, `standard`, `conservative`, `solo` modes

### üèóÔ∏è **Complete Architecture Overhaul**

## 4.0.8-Xentraxx

### Interactive ZIP File Extraction Restored

#### Major Feature Restoration
- **Restored interactive ZIP file extraction functionality** that was previously deprecated due to photo loss issues
- Added comprehensive security measures to prevent data loss and security vulnerabilities
- Implemented user-friendly choice between automatic ZIP extraction or using pre-extracted directories

#### New Interactive ZIP Features
- **`askIfUnzip()` function**: Provides users with clear options for handling Google Takeout data:
  - Option 1: Select ZIP files for automatic extraction (Recommended)
  - Option 2: Use already extracted directory
- **Enhanced `getZips()` function**: Improved file picker with better validation and user feedback
- **Secure `unzip()` function**: Comprehensive ZIP extraction with multiple safety layers

#### Security and Safety Improvements
- **ZIP Slip Protection**: Prevents malicious ZIP files from extracting outside the target directory
- **Cross-platform filename sanitization**: Handles encoding issues and invalid characters safely
- **Comprehensive error handling**: User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
- **File integrity validation**: Verifies ZIP files before extraction
- **Progress reporting**: Real-time feedback during extraction process

#### Technical Enhancements
- **`_extractZipSafely()` helper**: Internal function with security checks and encoding handling
- **`_sanitizeFileName()` helper**: Cross-platform filename normalization and safety checks
- **`_handleExtractionError()` helper**: Context-specific error handling with detailed guidance
- **`SecurityException` class**: Custom exception for handling security-related extraction issues

#### Workflow Integration
- Seamlessly integrated into interactive mode with clear user prompts

### Extension Fixing Feature

- Added comprehensive file extension correction functionality to handle mismatched MIME types and extensions
- Added three CLI flags for different extension fixing behaviors:
  - `--fix-extensions`: Fixes incorrect extensions except for TIFF-based files (e.g., RAW formats)
  - `--fix-extensions-non-jpeg`: More conservative mode that also skips actual JPEG files  
  - `--fix-extensions-solo-mode`: Standalone mode that fixes extensions and exits without further processing
- Added interactive prompts for extension fixing configuration with three options for user convenience
- Enhanced EXIF writing error messages to suggest using `--fix-extensions` when extension/MIME type mismatches are detected
- Added comprehensive test coverage for extension fixing functionality including edge cases

### JSON File Matching Improvements

- Added support for removing partial extra format suffixes from truncated filenames (issue #29)
- Enhanced JSON file matching for media files with filename truncation due to filesystem limits
- Added `removePartialExtraFormats` function to handle cases where suffixes like "-ed" need to be removed to match corresponding JSON files
- Improved date extraction reliability for files with truncated names ending in partial extra format patterns

#### Technical Details

When filenames are truncated due to filesystem character limits, partial suffixes (e.g., "-ed" from "-edited") can prevent proper JSON file matching for date extraction. The new functionality identifies and removes these partial patterns, allowing the JSON extractor to find corresponding metadata files and extract accurate photo dates.

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

- Fixed EXIF writing to properly handle files with incorrect extensions by detecting MIME type mismatches
- Improved error logging with more informative messages about extension/MIME type conflicts
- Updated statistics reporting to include count of fixed file extensions
- Enhanced interactive mode with better user guidance for extension fixing options

### Technical Details

The extension fixing feature addresses a common issue where Google Photos' "data saving" option compresses images to JPEG format but retains original file extensions, or where web-downloaded images have incorrect extensions. The tool now:

1. Reads file headers to detect actual MIME type
2. Compares with extension-based MIME type detection
3. Skips TIFF-based files (like RAW formats) as they're often misidentified
4. Renames files with correct extensions and updates associated JSON metadata files
5. Provides detailed logging of the fixing process

The feature integrates seamlessly with the existing EXIF writing workflow, ensuring metadata can be properly written to files after extension correction.

## 4.0.1-wacheee-xentraxx-beta

### Fork/Alternate version 
### This change is a big overhaul of the project, so only the major improvements or potential breaking changes are mentioned
### This version was developed mainly by @Xentraxx (https://github.com/Xentraxx/)

#### Tl;dr

- Added support for reading EXIF data from JXL (JPEG XL), ARW, RAW, DNG, CRW, CR3, NRW, NEF and RAF files internally.
- Adeded support for reading and writing coordinates and DateTime from and to exif for almost all file formats.
- Added a "--write-exif" flag which will write missing EXIF information (coordinates and DateTime) from json to EXIF for jpg and jpeg files
- Added support to get DateTime from .MOV, .MP4 and probably many other video formats through exiftool. You need to download it yourself (e.g. from here: https://exiftool.org/), rename it to exiftool.exe and make sure the folder you keep it in is in your $PATH variable or in the same folder as gpth.
- Added verbose mode (--verbose or -v)
- File size is not limited anymore by default but can be limited using the --limit-filesize flag for systems with low RAM (like a NAS).
- Fixed [PhotoMigrator](https://github.com/jaimetur/PhotoMigrator) integration by finding exiftool in more locations.
- Fixed some typos
- Fixed emoji to hex encoding and decoding and added support for BMP emojis in addition to surrowgate.
- Fixed some tests 


#### General improvements

- upgraded dependencies and fixed breaking changes
- updated dart to a minimum version of 3.8.0 of the dart SDK
- included image, intl and coordinate_converter packages
- applied a list of coding best practices through lint rules to code
- added/edited a bunch of comments and changed unnecessary print() to log() for debugging and a better user experience
- Divided code in steps through comments and included steps in output for readability, debuggability and to make it easier to follow the code
- checked TODOs in README.md
- Added TODOs to look into in code through //TODO comments
- moved json_extractor file into date_extractor folder
- added unit tests for new write-exif functionality
- made CLI --help output more readable through line breaks
- renamed some variables/functions to better reflect their purpose
- moved step 8 (update creation time) before final output
- added output how often DateTime and Coordinates have been written in EXIF at the final output
- changed that test data will be created in test subfolder instead of project root directory
- Added consistent log levels to log output to quickly differenciate between informational and error logs
- Added logging of elapsed time for each step.
- Exposed the maxFileSize flag as an argument (--limit-filesize) to set if necessary, It's now deactivated by default to support larger files like videos.
- Added DateTime extraction method statistics to the final output - shows how many files had their dates extracted through which method
- Added elapsed time logging for each processing step
- Improved Github actions

#### Bug fixes

- fixed existing unit tests which would fail on windows
- Fixed Github Actions

#### Added functionality

- Support for writing coordinates and DateTime to EXIF
  - Added new CLI option "--write-exif".
  - When enabled, the script will check if the associated json of any given file contains coordinates and if the file does not yet have them in its EXIF data, the script will add them.
  - When enabled, the script will check if a DateTime has been extracted from any of the given extraction methods and if the file has no EXIF DateTime set, it will add the DateTime to the EXIF data 'DateTime', 'DateTimeOriginal'and 'DateTimeDigitized'.
  - Added verbose mode (--verbose or -v) with log levels info, warning and error.

- Moved from the stale "exif" package to "exif_reader" for dart local exif reading, the image library for local jpeg exif writing and the external exiftool for all other EXIF reading and writing (images and videos)
  - The move to exif_reader adds support for extracting DateTime from JXL (JPEG XL), ARW, RAW, DNG, CRW, CR3, NRW, NEF and RAF files, and video formats like MOV, MP4, etc.
  - Exiftool needs to be in $PATH variable or in the same folder as the running binary. If not, that's okay. Then we fall back to exif_reader. But if you have ExifTool locally, Google Photos Takeout Helper now supports reading CreatedDateTime EXIF data for almost all media formats.

- Added new interactive prompts:
  - Option to write EXIF data to files (--write-exif)
  - Option to limit file size for systems with low RAM (--limit-filesize)

#### Limitations
- As mentioned on the PR https://github.com/Wacheee/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper/pull/13#issuecomment-2910289503 this version can be slower than 3.6.x-wacheee in Windows because is using PowerShell to create shortcuts (FFI is causing heap exception)

### Just a few patches ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

- put stuff in `date-unknown` also when not div-to-dates - #245
- fix extras detection on mac - #243
- add note to not worry about album finding ;)
- nice message when trying to run interactive on headless

## 3.4.2

### Bug fixes again üêõ

- (maybe?) fix weird windoza trailing spaces in folder names (literally wtf??) - #212
  
  Not sure about this one so hope there will be no day-1 patch üòáüôè

- update to Dart 3 üî•
- recognize `.mts` files as videos, unlike Apache üòí - #223
- change shortcuts/symlinks to relative so it doesn't break on folder move ü§¶ - #232
- don't fail on set-file-modification errors - turns out there are lot of these - #229

### Happy takeouts üëΩ

## 3.4.1

- Lot of serious bug fixes
  - Interactive unzipping was disabled because it sometimes lost *a lot of* photos ;_;
    
    Sorry if anyone lost anything - now I made some visual instruction on how to unzip
  - Gracefully handle powershell fail - it fails with non-ascii names :(
- Great improvement on json matching - now, my 5k Takeout has 100% matches!

## 3.4.0

### Albums üéâ

It finally happened everyone! It wasn't easy, but I think I nailed it and everything should perfectly üëå

You get **_üî•FOURüî•_** different options on how you want your albums üò± - detailed descriptions about them is at: https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper/discussions/187#discussion-4980576

(This also automatically nicely covers Trash/Archive, so previous solution that originally closed the https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper/issues/138 was replaced)

### Happy Take-outing ü•≥ 

## 3.3.5

- Address #178 issues in logs - instructions on what to do

  Sorry but this is all i can do for now :( we may get actual fix if https://github.com/brendan-duncan/archive/pull/244 ever moves further

## 3.3.4

- New name-guess patterns from @matt-boris <3
- Support 19**-s and 18**-s while name guessing
  > First camera was invented in 1839. I don't underestimate you guys anymore :eyes:
- Fix path errors on windoza while unzipping #172
- Fix #175 bad guessing json files with `...(1)` stuff

## 3.3.3

- Fix memory crashes :D
- nicer names for split-to-dates thanks to @denouche #168 <3

## 3.3.2

- Bump SDK and dependencies

## 3.3.1

### Fix bugs introduced in `v3.3.0` ü§ì

- #147 Support `.tgz` files too
- #145 **DON'T** use ram memory equal to zip file thanks to `asyncWrite: true` flag üôÉ
- #143 don't crash when encoding is other than `utf8` üç∞
- #136 #144 - On windzoa, set time to 1970 if it's before that - would love to *actually* fix this, but Dart doesn't let me :/

## 3.3.0

- Fix #143 - issues when encoding is not utf8 - sadly, others are still not supported, just skipped
- Ask for divide-to-folders in interactive
- Close #138 - support Archive/Trash folders!

  Implementation of this is a bit complicated, so may break, but should work 99% times
- Fix #134 - nicely tell user what to do when no "year folders" instead of exceptions
- Fix #92 - Much better json finding!
  
  It now should find all of those `...-edited(1).jpg.json` - this also makes it faster because it rarely falls back to reading exif, which is slower
- More small fixes and refactors

### Enjoy even faster and more stable `gpth` everyone ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥

## 3.2.0

- Brand new ‚ú®interactive mode‚ú® - just double click ü§ò
  - `gpth` now uses üíÖdiscontinuedüíÖ [`file_picker_desktop`](https://pub.dev/packages/file_picker_desktop) to launch pickers for user to select output folder and input...
  - ...zips ü§ê! because it also decompresses the takeouts for you! (People had ton of trouble of how to join them etc - no worries anymore!)
- Donation link

## 3.1.1

- Code sign windoza exe with self-made cert

## 3.1.0

- Added `--divide-to-dates` üéâ

## 3.0.0

- Dart!
- Speed
- Consistency - it is well known what script does, what does it copy and what not
- Stable album detection (tho still don't know what to do with it)
- [Testing!](https://youtu.be/UGSgpvjHp9o?t=292)
- Better json matching
- `--guess-from-name` is now a default
- `--skip-extras-harder` is missing for now
- `--divide-to-dates` is missing for now
- End-to-end tests are gone, but they're not as required since we have a lod of Units instead üëç
