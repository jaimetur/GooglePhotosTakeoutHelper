Transform your chaotic Google Photos Takeout into organized photo libraries with proper dates, albums, and metadata.

## What This Tool Does

When you export photos from Google Photos using [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/), you get a mess of folders with weird `.json` files and broken timestamps. This tool:

- ✅ **Organizes photos chronologically** with correct dates
- ✅ **Restores album structure** with multiple handling options
- ✅ **Fixes timestamps** from JSON metadata and EXIF data
- ✅ **Writes GPS coordinates and timestamps** back to media files
- ✅ **Removes duplicates** automatically
- ✅ **Handles special formats** (HEIC, Motion Photos, etc.)

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Your Photos from Google Takeout

1. Go to [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/)
2. Deselect all, then select only **Google Photos**
3. Download all ZIP files

### 2. Extract and Merge

Unzip all files and merge them so you have one unified "Takeout" folder.

**⚠️ Keep the original ZIPs as backup!**

### 3. Install Prerequisites

**ExifTool** (required for metadata handling):

- **Windows**: Download from [exiftool.org](https://exiftool.org/) and rename `exiftool(-k).exe` to `exiftool.exe`
  - Place `exiftool.exe` in your system PATH, or
  - Place `exiftool.exe` in the same folder as `gpth.exe`
  ```bash
  # Or with Chocolatey (automatically adds to PATH):
  choco install exiftool
  ```
- **Mac**: 
  ```bash
  brew install exiftool
  ```
  - Or download from [exiftool.org](https://exiftool.org/) and place `exiftool` in PATH or same folder as `gpth`
- **Linux**: 
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl
  ```
  - Or download from [exiftool.org](https://exiftool.org/) and place `exiftool` in PATH or same folder as `gpth`

**Note**: If ExifTool is not found in PATH or the same directory as GPTH, the tool will fall back to basic EXIF reading with limited format support.

### 4. Download and Run GPTH

1. Download the latest executable from [releases](https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper/releases)
2. **Interactive Mode** (recommended for beginners):
   - Windows: Double-click `gpth.exe`
   - Mac/Linux: Run `./gpth-macos` or `./gpth-linux` in terminal
3. Follow the prompts to select input/output folders and options

## Album Handling Options

GPTH offers several ways to handle your Google Photos albums:

### 🔗 Shortcut (Recommended)
**What it does:** Creates shortcuts/symlinks from album folders to files in `ALL_PHOTOS`. The original files are moved to `ALL_PHOTOS`, and shortcuts are created in album folders.

**Advantages:**
- Saves maximum disk space (no duplicate files)
- Maintains album organization
- Fast processing

**Disadvantages:**
- Shortcuts may break when moving folders between systems
- Not all applications support shortcuts/symlinks
- Windows shortcuts (.lnk files) don't work on Mac/Linux

**Best for:** Most users who want space efficiency and plan to keep photos on the same system.

### 📁 Duplicate Copy
**What it does:** Creates actual file copies in both `ALL_PHOTOS` and album folders. Each photo appears as a separate physical file in every location.

**Advantages:**
- Works across all systems and applications
- Complete independence between folders
- Safe for moving/copying folders between devices
- Album photos remain accessible even if `ALL_PHOTOS` is deleted

**Disadvantages:**
- Uses significantly more disk space (multiplied by number of albums)
- Slower processing due to file copying
- Changes to one copy don't affect others

**Best for:** Users who need maximum compatibility, plan to share folders across different systems, or have plenty of disk space.

### 🔄 Reverse Shortcut
**What it does:** The opposite of shortcut mode. Files remain in their original album folders, and shortcuts are created in `ALL_PHOTOS` pointing to the album locations.

**Advantages:**
- Preserves album-centric organization
- Original files stay in their natural album context
- Good for users who primarily browse by albums

**Disadvantages:**
- `ALL_PHOTOS` becomes dependent on album folders
- If a photo is in multiple albums, only one copy exists (in first album found)
- Shortcuts in `ALL_PHOTOS` may break if album folders are moved

**Best for:** Users who primarily organize and browse photos by albums rather than chronologically.

### 📄 JSON
**What it does:** Creates a single `ALL_PHOTOS` folder with all files, plus an `albums-info.json` file containing metadata about which albums each file belonged to.

**Advantages:**
- Most space-efficient option
- Programmatically accessible album information
- Simple folder structure
- Perfect for developers or automated processing

**Disadvantages:**
- No visual album folders
- Requires custom software to utilize album information
- Not user-friendly for manual browsing

**Best for:** Developers, users migrating to photo management software that can read JSON metadata, or those who don't care about visual album organization.

### ❌ Nothing
**What it does:** Ignores albums entirely and creates only `ALL_PHOTOS` with files from year folders. Album-only files are included if they can be linked to year folders.

**Advantages:**
- Simplest processing
- Fastest execution
- Clean, single-folder result
- No complex album logic

**Disadvantages:**
- Completely loses album organization
- Some album-only photos might be skipped
- No way to recover album information later

**Best for:** Users who don't care about album organization and just want all photos in chronological order.

## Important Notes

- **File Movement:** By default, GPTH moves (not copies) files to save space. Use `--copy` flag if you want to preserve the original takeout structure.
- **Album-Only Photos:** Some photos exist only in albums (not in year folders). GPTH handles these differently depending on the mode chosen.
- **Duplicate Handling:** If a photo appears in multiple albums, the behavior varies by mode (shortcuts link to same file, duplicate-copy creates multiple copies, etc.).

## Command Line Usage

## Features & Capabilities

### 📅 Date Extraction
GPTH uses multiple methods to determine correct photo dates:
1. **JSON metadata** (most accurate)
2. **EXIF data** from photo files
3. **Filename patterns** (Screenshot_20190919-053857.jpg, etc.)
4. **Aggressive matching** for difficult cases

### 🔍 Duplicate Detection
Removes identical files using content hashing, keeping the best copy (shortest filename, most metadata).

### 🌍 GPS Coordinates & Timestamps
Extracts location data and timestamps from JSON files and writes them to media file EXIF data for compatibility with photo viewers and other applications.

### 🎯 Smart File Handling
- **Motion Photos**: Pixel .MP/.MV files can be converted to .mp4
- **HEIC/RAW support**: Handles modern camera formats
- **Unicode filenames**: Properly handles international characters
- **Large files**: Optional size limits for resource-constrained systems

### 📁 Flexible Organization
- Multiple date-based folder structures
- Preserve or reorganize album structure
- Copy or move files (safety vs. efficiency)

## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries
Download from [releases page](https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper/releases)

### Package Managers
- **Arch Linux**: `yay -S gpth-bin`

### Building from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper.git
cd GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper
dart pub get
dart compile exe bin/gpth.dart -o gpth
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No photos found"**: Make sure you have a unified Takeout folder structure with "Photos from YYYY" folders.

**Permission errors**: Run with administrator/sudo privileges if moving files across drives.

**Memory issues**: Use `--limit-filesize` for systems with limited RAM.

**Encoding errors**: Some JSON files may have encoding issues; the tool handles most cases automatically.

### Platform-Specific Notes

**Windows**: Creation time updates require administrator privileges.

**macOS**: You may need to allow the executable in Security & Privacy settings.

**Linux**: Ensure ExifTool is installed for full functionality.

## After Migration

### Recommended Apps
- **[Immich](https://immich.app/)**: Self-hosted Google Photos alternative
- **[PhotoPrism](https://photoprism.org/)**: AI-powered photo management
- **[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)**: Sync photos across devices while preserving dates

### Android Users
Standard file managers reset photo dates when moving files. Use **Simple Gallery** to preserve timestamps.
