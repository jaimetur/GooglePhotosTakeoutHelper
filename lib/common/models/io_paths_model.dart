/// **INPUT/OUTPUT PATH DATA MODEL**
///
/// Domain model for holding resolved and validated input and output directory paths.
/// This provides type safety and clarity for path handling throughout the
/// argument parsing and validation process.
///
/// **PURPOSE:**
/// - Encapsulates the two required paths in a single domain object
/// - Provides type safety for path passing between functions
/// - Makes function signatures clearer and more maintainable
/// - Enables future extension with additional path-related metadata
///   (e.g., a flag indicating whether the input was extracted from ZIPs)
/// - Follows clean architecture principles by keeping data models in domain layer
///
/// **USAGE:**
/// Used by path resolution services and configuration builders to return validated
/// input and output directory paths from either CLI arguments or interactive mode prompts.
